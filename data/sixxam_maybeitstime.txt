[Verse 1]
All the scars and all the lines
On my face, they show the times
I've abandoned my own life
Why I can't breathe, I can't eat
So I just drink myself to sleep
And embrace this morbid price

[Chorus]
Maybe it's time to heal
Maybe it's time to try
Maybe it's time to deal with all the pieces in my life
Well, maybe I'll sober up
Maybe before I die
Maybe I'll finally deal with all the wreckage in my life

[Post-Chorus]
Maybе it's time (Oh-oh)
Maybe it's time

[Verse 2]
I'm oldеr now, I'm breaking down
My regrets, they turn to dust
Soon enough they'll blow away
When I was young, I was dumb
But I was never strong enough
I wish I had the guts to say

[Chorus]
Maybe it's time to heal
Maybe it's time to try
Maybe it's time to deal with all the pieces in my life
Maybe I'll sober up
Maybe before I die
Maybe I'll finally deal with all the wreckage in my life

[Bridge]
(Maybe it's time)
And this was self-inflicted
Yeah, I was on a mission (Maybe it's time)
To ruin everything in life (Maybe it's time)
But now I'm so damn ready
Just take my hand and steady (Maybe it's time)
And we will make it through the night

[Chorus]
Maybe it's time to heal
Maybe it's time to try
Maybe it's time to deal with all the pieces in my life
Maybe I'll sober up
Maybe before I die
Maybe I'll finally deal with all the wreckage in my life

[Post-Chorus]
Maybe it's time (Oh-oh)
Maybe it's time
Maybe it's time
Maybe it's time
Maybe it's time

[Outro]
Maybe it's time
